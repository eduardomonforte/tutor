# Tutor

This app will turn the coding bootcamp topics into a learner’s roadmap. With this app, the Trilogy Education community will be able to view, upload and bookmark the most relevant resources from any particular topic **from class.**
The idea is to have a curated collection of **proved tutorials and articles** that we’ve been finding along the way and that were able to help us successfully go through our coding bootcamp experience.

## Why Tutor?

There is an uncountable amount interesting and useful tutorials or articles out there, however, one of the ‘downsides’ when learning how to code is that **there are many ways to do one thing.** So the way or methods you learned, practiced, and thought you mastered in class won’t necessarily be something that you could easily find out there. And it’s very frustrating and discouraging.

## How does it work

* A single ‘sign-in / up’ button will login or register the users and take them to their dashboard.

* Once there, a collection of resources will be displayed in a pinterest-like format. The user will be able to swift through the database by selecting a specific week, with each week containing different topics.

* The content has been organized following the bootcamp program structure so that the user can follow it on a week by week basis and get the necessary material to complement the classes.

## Features

The main feature of the app is the ability to store the most useful and proved resources out there (those that closely follow the program’s methods) and to be able to go back and view or read them as many times as possible.

There is no maximum amount of resources that can be uploaded by the users, nevertheless, there is a ‘community rating system’ that will keep the most useful and relevant cards always on top.If you find any particular card very useful and it’s not on the top of the list, you can click the bookmark icon and save it to your collection.
